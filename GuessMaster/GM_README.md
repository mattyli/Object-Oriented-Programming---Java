Notes for my this project submission

Things can be optimized better:

1. The program works as is, but it could be tidied up with the addition of helper functions, which were not added in the interest of time.
2. I should have used an array list which would have dynamic size, but per the assignment instructions I had to use a static array.

I take full credit for the Entity.java, GuessMaster.java program whilst, the Date.java file was primarily written by ELEC 279 course staff with modification by me.
